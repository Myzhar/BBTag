The idea behind BBTag was to provide more options and      flexibility for labeling images as well as being easily portable across      platform (thanks to <a  href="http://www.qt.io/">Qt</a>).</p>    <p><br>    </p>    <h2><span  style="text-decoration: underline;"><span  style="color: rgb(18, 107, 200);">Special          thanks</span></span></h2>    <p>Last but not least, many thanks to Adrian Rosebrock and his Python      tutorials + courses through <a  title="PyImageSearch"  href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/">PyImageSearch</a>,      which gave me the motivation for this little project.</p>    <p><br>    </p>    <h2><span  style="text-decoration: underline;"><span  style="color: rgb(18, 107, 200);">Author</span></span></h2>    <p>I'm nobody with a little experience in Qt and C++ and I just figured this      tool could be helpful for intensive tagging of images for machine learning      purposes (it is at least to me :P).
