          Help Document</span></span></h1>    <h2><span  style="color: rgb(18, 107, 200);"><span  style="text-decoration: underline;">Goal</span></span></h2>    <p>BBTag is meant to be used for tagging (i-e labeling rectangles) images,      which is a tedious task for people who need to make their own dataset for      supervised machine learning. In a nutshell, the advantages of BBTag are:</p>    <ul>      <li><span  style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">multiple          labeling:</span> each image can be tagged multiple times with        different labels.</li>      <li><span  style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">label          organization:</span> a BBTag session is grouped by label. It becomes        very easy to know which labels are present in each image without having        to view the images one by one. An "Untagged" section is also provided by        default to quickly find out which images need to be tagged.</li>      <li><span  style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-style: italic;">worry-free          tagging:</span> add and remove tags as needed. If you got a tag wrong,        delete it and tag again without impacting any other tag.</li>      <li><em  style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">selective saving:</em> save your        entire BBTag session or just a subset based on image and/or labels. You        can reuse the same pool of images for different purposes (e.g. save only        "faces" and "body", then "person", etc. regardless of the overlap        between each tag).</li>      <li><em  style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">XML or image part output:</em>        save your dataset as</li>      <ul>        <li><span  style="text-decoration: underline;">XML file:</span> it will          containing the path to images and label bounding box coordinates. This          file can be directly input in dlib for instance. You may also read the          data with python and appropriate XML package.</li>        <li><span  style="text-decoration: underline;">Image part files:</span>          it will output one folder per label. Each label folder will contain          the image part cropped by the bounding boxes for that label. It could          be useful for direct input to train Deep Learning networks for          instance.</li>      </ul>    </ul>    <br>    <h2><span  style="color: rgb(18, 107, 200);"><span  style="text-decoration: underline;">How
          to use?</span></span></h2>    <ol>      <li><strong>&nbsp;<span  style="text-decoration: underline;">Import images</span></strong><br>        There are 2 ways to bring images in the BBTag session:        <ul>          <li> Load a selection of images through the directory explorer: these            images will be added to the current session (i-e images and tags            already present are left untouched)</li>          <li>Load a XML file referencing images and tags: if "Open XML" is            chosen, the current session is cleared of existing images and tags            first. If "Open XML and Merge" is chosen, the current session is            left untouched.</li>        </ul>        <br>      </li>      <li><strong>&nbsp;<span  style="text-decoration: underline;">Add/Remove            Labels</span></strong><br>        You can add as many label as needed by simply clicking on the "+" button        (or using the "+" key as shortcut). By default a random color is picked        for you. To change the color or the name of the label, simply        right-click on it and choose "change color/label" action.<br>        <strong  style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Be careful when removing a label</strong>:        all the bounding boxes of all the images belonging to that label will be        removed. To do so, click on the "x" button (or use the "Del" key        shortcut). To remove all the bounding boxes for a specific image, select        only that image under the label (and not the entire label) before        clicking on "x" button.<br>        <br>      </li>      <li><strong>&nbsp;<span  style="text-decoration: underline;">Tag/Untag            Images</span></strong></li>      <li><strong>&nbsp;<span  style="text-decoration: underline;">Export Tags</span></strong></li>    </ol>  </body></html>
